Download and unzip everything into a single folder, does not matter where.

Run
pip install -r requirements.txt
inside of your vscode terminal (or path terminal, whichever you're using).

Open main.py and change the map, gamemode and/or strategy. Currently there are only 2, both on dark castle deflation. Make sure you have the right hero selected if a hero name is mentioned in the strategy and start on an empty run while the game is unpaused. Run main.py and alttab to BTD6 and wait 3 seconds. If using visual studio code use cntrl + f5 to run. This somehow does not break it.
